# Reading-Image-as-Audio
An experimental MATLAB script to read image as audio!

The script performs some basic operations on the image to make it readable as audio.

#Any image can be used for the purpose. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT can lead to data being lost partially or as whole.
Therefore DO NOT use any important picture.

## Running the script
+ Keep the picture in the same folder as the MATLAB script file.
+ Name the picture 'Rainflower.jpg' or change the image name in the script.
+ Run the script.

### Note
This file was written in MATLAB 2017 livescript format (.mlx). However, the code can be run as a normal MATLAB script with extension ".m"
(the file should be appropraitely renamed in that case).

I haven't run the file in 'gnu octave', however the script should run alright with some modifications if needed.
